By gathering near the same tree, they can take advantage of the available food source while also benefiting from the protection that the tree provides from potential predators.\n\nAdditionally, giraffes are social animals and often form loose groups called \"towers\" or \"journeys.\" These groups can provide safety in numbers, as they can keep an eye out for predators and alert each other to potential threats. So, the giraffes might be gathering near the same tree because it is a good source of food and also offers some degree of safety in numbers.", "time": 5.448869054998795, "num_starting_tokens": 2170, "num_generated_tokens": 238}

Additionally, giraffes have a prehensile tongue that can be up to 18 inches long, which they use to strip leaves from branches.\n\nTheir height and long necks also give them a good vantage point to spot predators from a distance, which is an added benefit of gathering in groups around a food source.", "time": 4.991441431999192, "num_starting_tokens": 2170, "num_generated_tokens": 206}

Birds are sensitive to noise, and prolonged exposure to loud noises can cause stress and affect their behavior.\n\n3. **Loss of Habitat**: The presence of a paved road suggests that the area might be developed, which can lead to the loss of natural habitats for the duck.\n\n4. **Predators**: The road could be a place where predators like cats or dogs might be present, posing a threat to the duck.\n\n5. **Food Availability**: The road might not provide an abundance of food sources for the duck, as it is not a natural environment for foraging.\n\n6. **Navigation**: The duck might have difficulty navigating the road, especially if it is not familiar with the area.\n\n7. **Human Interaction**: The duck might encounter humans who might not be aware of the bird's presence and could potentially harm it.\n\n8. **Disease**: The road could be a place where the duck might come into contact with other animals or humans, increasing the risk of disease transmission.\n\nIt's important to note that the duck's ability to cope with these challenges will depend on its species, individual resilience, and the specific conditions of the environment.", "time": 8.602346347999628, "num_starting_tokens": 2171, "num_generated_tokens": 382}

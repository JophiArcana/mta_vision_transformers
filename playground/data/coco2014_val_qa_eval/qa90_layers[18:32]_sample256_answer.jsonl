{"question_id": 35, "text": "These giraffes are likely gathering near the same tree because it provides them with food. Giraffes are herbivores and primarily feed on leaves, flowers, and fruits of trees, with the acacia tree being one of their favorites. The tree in the image appears to be an acacia, which is a common food source for giraffes.\n\nGiraffes have a unique anatomy that allows them to reach high into the trees to feed on the leaves that are inaccessible to other herbivores. Their long necks and legs, along with their prehensile tongues, enable them to browse at heights that other animals cannot reach. This adaptation gives them a competitive advantage in their natural habitat, where they can access food resources that are not available to other herbivores.\n\nIn the image, the giraffes are standing close to the tree, which suggests that they are either feeding on the leaves or waiting for their turn to do so. The presence of multiple giraffes in the same area also indicates that the tree is a shared food source, which is common in the wild where resources are often limited.", "time": 6.530672848999984, "num_starting_tokens": 2170, "num_generated_tokens": 251}

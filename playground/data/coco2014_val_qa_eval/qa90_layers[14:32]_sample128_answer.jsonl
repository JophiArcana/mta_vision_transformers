The disturbance can lead to changes in the behavior of the birds, such as altering their feeding patterns or altering their migration routes.\n\nAt higher altitudes, the impact of aircraft on wildlife is generally less, as the noise from the aircraft is less disruptive to the behavior of the birds.

{"question_id": 83, "text": "The image shows a person on a motorcycle with a person walking in front of them. The person on the motorcycle is following the person walking, which suggests that they are moving at a slower pace than the motorcycle can maintain. This could lead to a few challenges:\n\n1. Safety: The person on the motorcycle needs to be cautious to ensure the safety of both themselves and the person walking.

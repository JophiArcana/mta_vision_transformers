Noise Pollution: The loud noise generated by the engines of the airplanes can disturb the natural behavior of the birds, causing them to change their feeding, breeding, and migration patterns.\n\n2. Habitat Disruption: The airplanes' presence can disrupt the natural habitat of the birds, as they may disturb the ground, water, and vegetation in the area. This can lead to changes in the distribution and abundance of the birds.\n\n3. Collisions: Birds may collide with the airplanes, especially if they are flying at low altitudes or in close proximity to the aircraft. This can lead to injuries or fatalities for the birds.\n\n4. Oil Spills: In the event of an oil spill from the airplanes, it can have a devastating impact on the birds and their habitat. Oil spills can contaminate the water and soil, making it difficult for the birds to find food and nesting sites.\n\n5. Chemical Exposure: The airplanes may also be carrying chemicals, such as deicing fluids, which can be harmful to the birds if they come into contact with the chemicals.\n\nOverall, the presence of large commercial airplanes near bird habitats can have significant environmental impacts on the birds, including noise pollution, habitat disruption, collisions, oil spills, and chemical exposure.

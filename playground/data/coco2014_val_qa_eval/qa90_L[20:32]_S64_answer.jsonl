Giraffes are herbivores and primarily feed on leaves, flowers, and fruits of trees, with the acacia tree being one of their favorites. The tree in the image appears to be an acacia, which is a common food source for giraffes.\n\nGiraffes have a unique feeding strategy, where they use their long necks to reach high branches that are inaccessible to other herbivores. This allows them to access a food source that is not competing with other animals. Additionally, their height and long legs give them a wide range of vision, which helps them spot predators from a distance.\n\nSo, the giraffes in the image are likely gathering near the tree to feed on its leaves, which is a natural behavior for these animals.", "time": 4.47860209099963, "num_starting_tokens": 2170, "num_generated_tokens": 193}

{"question_id": 35, "text": "The giraffes in the image are likely gathering near the same tree for several reasons. One reason is that giraffes are herbivores and primarily feed on leaves, flowers, and fruits of trees, particularly acacia trees. The tree in the image appears to be an acacia, which is a common food source for giraffes. By gathering around the same tree, they can easily access their primary food source.\n\nAnother reason could be related to social behavior. Giraffes are social animals and often form loose groups called \"towers\" or \"journeys.\" They may gather around a tree to rest, socialize, or keep an eye out for predators. The tree provides a convenient spot for them to congregate while still allowing them to keep an eye on their surroundings.\n\nLastly, the tree might be providing shade, which can be a valuable resource in the hot environments where giraffes typically live. By standing near the tree, they can take advantage of the shade to regulate their body temperature and rest.", "time": 5.126344643000266, "num_starting_tokens": 2170, "num_generated_tokens": 232}
